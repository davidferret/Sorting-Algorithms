# Sorting Algorithms Program

This program sorts numerical data using multiple sorting algorithms and allows users to choose between manual input or file loading. It provides options for sorting in ascending or descending order and saves the sorted data to a file.

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Supports Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.
- **Customizable Sorting Order**: Users can select ascending or descending sorting.
- **File Handling**: Supports loading data from a file and saving sorted results.
- **Interactive Input**: Allows users to manually enter numbers for sorting.
- **Optimized Performance**: Includes early stopping for Bubble Sort and efficient Quick Sort and Merge Sort implementations.
